<h2 style="font-family: PlutoSansCondMedium,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-decoration: none;color: #0e76bc;" align="center"><strong>POP</strong></h2>
<p>In a broad sense, pop is any music based on memorable melodies, repeated sections (usually, but not always, verses and choruses), and a tight, 
concise structure that keeps the listener's focus on those elements. Pop as a musical style, however, began in the late '90s and early 2000s, 
when a pair of major forces began narrowing and focusing commercial tastes. First, the heavy influence of rap and R&B made the pop singles charts 
more homogeneous than ever. Then<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">, the advent of the television contest American Idol further centralized what people agreed on
as pop music. As such, Pop is primarily influenced by the time's two most broadly popular styles: R&B and adult contemporary. The sound of Backstreet 
Boys and Britney Spears in the mid-to-late '90s was of prime importance to the genesis of Pop, as were R&B superstars Aaliyah and R. Kelly, both of whom 
had a heavy adult contemporary angle to their material. By the 2000s, a parade of varying artists were catering to the mainstream with a similar type of 
pop music -- artists as diverse as Destiny's Child, Black Eyed Peas, Faith Hill, Maroon 5, Keith Urban, and AmIdol alums like Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken. 
Not everything they recorded was Pop, but in varying degrees they included several bids to the mainstream each year and on each album. Although the essentials 
of songcraft were still much in abundance, their songs were as much about production as performance.</span></p>

<h2 style="font-family: PlutoSansCondMedium,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-decoration: none;color: #0e76bc;" align="center"><strong>ROCK</strong></h2>
<p>The history of rock music has been volatile and unpredictable as the genre has constantly redefined and reinvented itself since its emergence in the late 1940s.
 Not surprisingly, then, it can be difficult to apply a straightforward definition to such a restless musical format.<span id="dots1">...</span> <span id="more1">But 
 while people might quibble over specifics, rock music can generally be described as hard-edged music performed with electric guitars, bass, and drums and usually 
 accompanied by lyrics sung by a vocalist. That sounds simple enough, but a closer look at the evolution of rock suggests how different styles and influences have 
 shaped its development over the years. As rock music entered the 21st century, the most successful acts had the same spirit as their '60s predecessors, even if 
 they sounded quite different. Linkin Park fuses hip-hop and metal, while 3 Doors Down emulates hard-rock traditions of the past while providing a contemporary spin. 
 Undoubtedly, rock music will keep evolving, drawing from its rich history while continuing to keep its ear open for the next sonic reinvention.</span></p>

<h2 style="font-family: PlutoSansCondMedium,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-decoration: none;color: #0e76bc;" align="center"><strong>Country</strong></h2>
<p>Like all other genres of music, the history of country music is a long and rich one. Musicians and music enthusiasts should know the history behind one 
of the most popular themes of music, and how it progressed, adapted and changed over the decades.<span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2">The origins of country music can be traced 
back to the early 1900s, specifically to American fiddlers of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. In the early 1920s, the first recorded country record was 
produced by Victor Records and the singer, Eck Robertson. But it would be a few more years before the “Father of Country” music would catapult the genre into 
the history books.Jimmie Rodgers is widely regarded as the Father of Country Music. His song, “Blue Yodel #1” sold more than 1 million copies in 1927 and 
launched his recording career, which unfortunately, didn’t last long. Rodgers died in 1933, just six years after his single hit the charts. But his influence 
in country music was cemented in history, and made way for other country stars whoquickly followed his lead.</span></p>
